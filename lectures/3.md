3 Data and Program Representation
=================================

Abstraction
-----------

- Digital logic provides the building blocks for the modern computer
- Meaninful computation on top of this system is unmanageable without abstraction
- Abstraction is the hiding of details behind interfaces

Logic Levels
------------

- Voltages thresholds such as 1.8V may be meaninful inside our RAM or CPU
- We **abstract** them as simply `true` and `false` or `1` and `0`

Bits and Bytes
--------------

- Data representation builds from digital logic
- A binary digit (**bit**) is can represent either a `0` or a `1`
- Multiple bits can be combined to represent larger values, such as a byte
- Modern systems use 8 bits in a byte

Possible values in a word
-------------------------

- A given number of bits can be used to represent a fixed number of integer values
- 8 bits can represent 256 values
- 16 bit can represent 65536 values
- In general we can represent $2^n$ values using $n$ bits

Hexadecimal
-----------

- Large strings of `1`s and `0`s can be challenging
- We may prefer base 16 (hexadecimal) to store bytes
- 1 base 16 digit represents 4 bits
- 2 base 16 digits represent a byte

Notation for constants
----------------------

- Hex constants often being with 0x e.g. 0xFFFF
- Binary constants often begin with 0b e.g. 0x1110111

Character Sets
--------------

- It is frequently useful to reprsent text, and not just numbers
- We need a way to map numbers to characters
- Defines 128 characters that can be encoded in 7 bits

Unicode
-------

- 7 bits can represent all characters used in English
- It is insufficient to handle other languages and uses (such as emojis)
- The unicode standard is able to handle these characters


Binary Arithmetic
-----------------

- We can represent arbitrary numbers in binary as we can in decimal
- Each position represents the next highest power of the base

Unsigned Integers
-----------------

- The positional representation described supports only values greater than zero
- It also suffers from integer overflow and underflow

Endianness
---------

- Some systems store high bytes first other story high bytes last
- The are called big endian and little endian

Negative Numbers
----------------

- Sign-magnitude - store the sign in a bit
- Two's complement - a negative is represented by subtracting 1 from the positive form and inverting every bit

Two's complement
----------------

- Allows a single piece of hardware for signed and unsigned operations
- The high bit value is negative

Fractional Numbers
------------------

- How can we represent fractional numbers?
- We could simply assign a decimal point location to integers
- A Fixed point approach limits space and precision when dealing with large and small numbers

Floating Point
--------------

- Represent the significant digits of a number seperate from the scale of the number
- Similar to scientific notation

---

Scientific Notation
-------------------

- $6.022 \times 10^{23}$
- Values are represented by a *mantissa* and *exponent*

Floating Point
--------------

- Binary representation
- Sign represented explicitly
- Normalized to remove leading zeroes in mantissa
- A normalized mantissa will always start with 1, so the leading bit can be dropped
- The exponent is biased to allow negative exponents

Floating Point Range
--------------------

- Floating point number can occupy a range greater than a similarly sized integer with a loss of precision

Data Aggregates
---------------

- We can combine multiple integers, floats, and characters into larger data structures
