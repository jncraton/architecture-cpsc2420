11 Virtual Memory
=================

Virtual Memory
--------------

- Hides details or limitation of unerlying memory behind a modified address space

Byte Addressing
---------------

- A memory controller that allows addressing by byte rather than word is an example of a simple virtual memory system

Memory Management Unit
----------------------

- MMU
- Creates a virtual address space for the processor
- All addresses used by the CPU are virtaul addresses translated by the MMU

Multiple memory system
----------------------

- An MMU can connect memories with different properties (word size, etc) into a single unified address space
- Memory requests are translated by the MMU and directed to the appropriate location in a physical memory

Ideal Implementation
--------------------

```python
if addr < 1000:
  memory1.fetch(addr)
else:
  memory2.fetch(addr - 1000)
```

Implementation
--------------

- Subtraction is too slow to be handled by the MMU
- Split address into memory page portion and physical address portion
- Look up page using high bits
- Use low bits as address in real memeory
- Page sizes must be powers of 2 for optimal performance

Holes
-----

- Virtual memory need not be contiguous
- The memory range may contain holes that do not map to a real memory
- Accessing these will result in an error

---

Most systems generally just have one type of main physical memory. Why do we use virtual memory at all?

Benefits
--------

- Homogenous integration of hardware
- Ease of programming
- Support for multiprogramming
- Protection of programs and data

Homogenous Integration
----------------------

- Different heterogenous memories can be mapped to a uniform memory space
- Systems with a main memory and GPU memory can access all memory in the same way

Ease of programming
-------------------

- Special instructions are not required to select memories
- A memory address is always just a memory address
- Copying between different physical memories is simple
- Using data between memeories is simple

Multiprocessing
---------------

- Virtual memory is needed to implement restrictions for process memory access and protection

---

Address   Process Purpose
-------- -------- --------
0x1010    Spotify Username
0x1020    Spotify Password
0x8010    Zoom    Username

What happens if Zoom accesses memory location 0x1020?

Data Protections
----------------

- Virtual memory can be used to secure program data
- Some pages can be mark as execute only or read-only

Partions
--------

- Early attempt at virtual memory
- Each process is assigned its own address space that is a subset of the total
- Process may have a *base* and *bound* that define their memory space

Partition Weaknesses
--------------------

- Inflexible
- Course-grained

Paging
------

- Memory is assigned to a process in blocks (pages) as needed
- Pages are mapped to physical memory by the MMU

---

Paging
------

- Requires a page table to be stored
- Lookups can be slow

Caching
-------

- Page table lookups can be slow (10 - 100 clock cycles)
- We can cache lookups to improve performance of repeated accesses
- This cache is called the translation lookaside buffer (TLB)

---

Demand Paging
-------------

- An operating systems running low on memory can store less used pages to disk
- Pages can be loaded back from disk on demand
- The storage for pages may reside on a swap partition, swap file, or page file depending on OS conventions

Security
--------

- Processes can't read or write memory that hasn't been mapped
- Address space becomes private

Buffer Overflows
----------------

- A buffer overflow or other memory error can allow an attacker to gain control over a process
- A return address can be overwritten to point to an area of memory controlled by a user
- The user now has complete control over the execution

NX Bit
------

- Modern CPUs has a feature that allows memory pages to be marked as not being executable to make certain classes of attacks harder to exploit.
