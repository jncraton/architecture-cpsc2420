Fractional Numbers
------------------

- How can we represent fractional numbers?
- We could simply assign a decimal point location to integers
- A Fixed point approach limits space and precision when dealing with large and small numbers

Floating Point
--------------

- Represent the significant digits of a number seperate from the scale of the number
- Similar to scientific notation

---

Scientific Notation
-------------------

- $6.022 \times 10^{23}$
- Values are represented by a *mantissa* and *exponent*

Floating Point
--------------

- Binary representation
- Sign represented explicitly
- Normalized to remove leading zeroes in mantissa
- A normalized mantissa will always start with 1, so the leading bit can be dropped
- The exponent is biased to allow negative exponents

Floating Point Range
--------------------

- Floating point number can occupy a range greater than a similarly sized integer with a loss of precision

Data Aggregates
---------------

- We can combine multiple integers, floats, and characters into larger data structures
