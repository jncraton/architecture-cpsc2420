9 Memory and Storage
====================

CPUs
----

- Execute instructions
- Have access to a limited number of registers to store data

Memory
------

- Used to store programs and data
- Any solid-state device that provides storage

Technology
----------

- Architects may select from a host of available technologies to store data
- Examples include DRAM and flash memories

Organization
------------

- Regardless of technology chosen, architects also determine how memory should be organized
- Organization determines how the technology is put together to form a working system

Memory Characteristics
----------------------

- Volatile or nonvolatile
- Random or sequential
- Read-write or read-only
- Primary or secondary

Volatile
--------

- Memory contents disappear without power
- Main memory is typically volatile

Non-volatile
------------

- Memory contents persist without power
- Long term data storage is frequently non-volatile

Memory Access
-------------

- **Random access** allows any value to be accessed at any time
- **Sequential access** reads values in the order they were inserted (FIFO)
- A tape drive is an example of a sequential access memory

Permanence
----------

- Some memories allow values to be updated, others do not
- Read-only Memory (ROM) can only be read
- Some memories are erasable, but can't be updated randomly

Memory Hiearchy
---------------

- Economic factors lead systems to include multiple memories
- Faster memories are usually more expensive
- Larger memories are usually more expensive
- Speed and size are both ultimately limited by physics

Instruction and Data Memory
---------------------------

- Instructions and data are generally stored together (Von Neumann architecture)
- They may sometimes be separated for performance or architecture reasons, such as storing initial instructions in ROM and caching instructions and data separately

Fetch and Store
---------------

- Memories support 2 basic operations
- Fetch - read a value from memory
- Store - write a value to memory

10 Physical Memory and Addressing
=================================

Random Access Memory
--------------------

- Most memory used by running programs is random access
- Programs can read and write arbitrary data values

Static RAM
----------

- Extension of digital logic
- Gates are combined to form latches (also called flip-flops)
- Latches can be used to store data for later use

SRAM Usage
----------

- SRAM is fast
- SRAM uses many transistors that must be powered so it consumes power and generates heat
- SRAM is typically only used where speed is critical

Dynamic RAM
-----------

- Store charge in a capacitor to represent a high value
- Read capacitor state to determine bit value
- Capacitors hold their charge without power, so are more efficient than SRAM designs

Capacitors
----------

- Store electric charge
- When a voltage is applied, a charge gathers
- Charge slowly discharges over time

Refresh
-------

- Charge is lost over time
- A circuit is needed to frequently refresh the charge
- A refresh reads the current value and stores it again at the proper level of charge
- Refreshes typically happen every 64ms or more

Density
-------

- Memory cells per square area
- Memory density has historically doubled every 18 months following Moore's law

Bandwidth
---------

- Bytes written per time
- Bytes read per time
- Read and write speed may be drastically different

Latency
-------

- Time required to execute a memory operation
- Memories may be high bandwidth and high latency
