6 Operand Addressing and Instruction Representation
===================================================

Operands Per Instruction
------------------------

- Halt requires none
- Logical not requires 1
- Add requires two
- We can include an extra for the result destination

Zero Address Architectures
--------------------------

- Instructions include no operands
- Operands are determined implicitly
- Values may be stored on a stack

---

```
push x
push 7
add
pop x
```

Stack machine example to add 7 to x

One Address Architectures
-------------------------

- Instructions include a single operand
- Intermediate values are stored in an intermediate register called an accumulator
- Require two instructions for certain operations (e.g. copy)

---

```
store x
addi 7
fetch x
```

Accumulator example

Two Address Architectures
-------------------------

- Instructions include two operands
- Most operations map to a single instruction
- Addresses may be thought of as `src` and `dst` for many instructions

Three Address Architectures
---------------------------

- Instructions include three operands
- Allows storing results without clobbering registers
