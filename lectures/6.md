5 Processor Tyes and Instruction Sets
=====================================

Necessary Operations
--------------------

- In order to compute any computable function, a CPU needs to support only a deceptively small number of operations
- For example, `increment`, `decrement`, and `branch_if_not_zero` are sufficient

Included Operations
-------------------

- A very small instruction set is not convenient for the programmer or efficient for the hardware
- We include more complex operations for reasons of efficency and convenience rather than to be able to compute new functions

Tradeoffs
---------

- Convenience
- Speed
- Hardware cost
- Power efficiency
- Thermal efficiency

Instruction Set
---------------

- The set of instruction types that a CPU can decode and execute
- The instruction set specification will describe exactly how each instruction is executed

Instruction Format
------------------

- Specified binary representation of instructions

Opcodes
-------

- Typically a number representing the operation to perform

Operands
--------

- The value(s) needed to perform an operation

Results
-------

- Value returned by operation
- Storage location may be fixed or read from the instruction

Instruction Format
------------------

- Typically a binary string
- Divided into opcodes, operands, and values
