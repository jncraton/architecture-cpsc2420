13 I/O
======

---

In order to be useful, CPUs need to communicate with external devices.

I/O Devices
-----------

- Keyboards
- Mice
- Displays
- Speakers
- Network

Communication
------------

- Data can be fed out of the CPU via special registers or instructions
- Communication may be parallel or serial

Serial Data
-----------

- A single wire is used to communication
- Simple and uses only one pin on the chip

Parallel Data
-------------

- Multiple wires are used for communication
- Uses more pins, but is generally faster

Multiplexing
------------

- Pins are limited, and wider parallel connection are faster, so we reuse the same pins for communication
