12 Caching
==========

---

- Main memory access is much slower than register access or computation
- Caching gives us a tool to improve memory latency

---

Caches
------

- Small
- Active
- Transparent
- Automatic

Terms
-----

- Cache hit - requested item was found in and sourced from cache
- Cache miss - requested item was not found in cache

Cache Performance
-----------------

Cache Replacement
-----------------

- The algorithm used for cache replacement has a strong impact on performance

Least recently used
-------------------

- An LRU eviction strategy is simple to understand
- When a new item needs to be added to a cache, we remove the oldest item in terms of access time
