7 CPUs: Mircocode, Protection, Modes
====================================

Central processors
------------------

- Modern computers are distributed systems with many processors
- main CPU, GPU, sound, wifi, cellular, etc
- A "central" processor can be thought of as orchestrating the others

CPU roles
---------

- Running applications
- Running OS
- Handling I/O
- Powering devices (including the whole computer) on and off

Protection and Privilege
------------------------

- Application programs need very limited access
- Certain parts of the operating system need unlimited access

Processor Modes
---------------

- Allow the process to change how instructions are handled
- Some instructions may be unavailable
- Some memory ranges may be unavailable
- Other privileges may be adjusted

Backwards Combatibility
-----------------------

- Processor modes can be used to allow new hardware to behave like old hardware
- Intel CPUs include compatibility mode in 32-bit CPUs to allow them to behave like their older 16-bit CPUs

Changing Modes
--------------

- Automatic - initiated by hardware
- Manual - initiated by instructions

Device I/O
----------

- Hardware may interupt the processor
- This will move control flow to a new location and likely adjust the processor mode

Operating System
----------------

- The OS needs full control of the system at time, so it will change modes as needed
- User programs should not have full control, so if they attempt to access memory 

Mode register
-------------

- A special purpose register may be used to store the current mode

Privilege Levels
-----------------

- How many privilege should we have?
- We need at least 2 in order to isolate application programs from the OS
