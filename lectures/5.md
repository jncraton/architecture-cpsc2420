4 Processors
============

Von Neumann Architecture
------------------------

- Architecture used by almost all modern computers
- A *stored program* resides in memory and is executed by a *processor*

Processor
---------

- Digital device the performs computation involving multiple steps
- Not complete computers
- Core building block of a computer
- Can be very basic or very complex

Processor Types
---------------

- Fixed logic
- Selectable logic
- Parameterized logic
- Programmable logic

Fixed Logic
-----------

- Can only perform one operation
- Graphics pipeline
- Sound system
- JPEG compression

Selectable Logic
----------------

- Can perform one of several operations
- Operations are defined at the time the processor is manufactured

Parameterized Logic
-------------------

- Computer pre-determined functions
- Provide additional parameters that adjust behavior
- JPEG compressor with tunable quality

Programmable Logic
------------------

- Instructions are read from memory and can be adjusted to run a multitude of operations

Hierarchical Structure
----------------------

- Modern CPUs are extremely complex
- We break them into subsystems to better understand them
- We may refer to different components as engines

Central Units
-------------

- Controller
- Compurational engine (ALU)
- Local data storage
- Internal connections
- External interface

Controller
----------

- Steps through program
- Coordinates actions

Computational Engine
--------------------

- Executes arithmetic and logical operations
- `add`, `subtract`, `and`, etc

Local Data Storage
------------------

- Used to store results of computations
- Modern CPUs use registers for this purpose

Internal connections
--------------------

- Connects other components together
- Also known as data path

External Interface
------------------

- Communicates with external devices
- Read/writes to main memory
- Performs I/O

Arithmetic Logic Unit
---------------------

- ALU
- Complex unit that can handle a variety of operations

Processor Roles
---------------

- Coprocessor
- Microcontroller
- Microsequencer
- Embedded sytem processor
- General purpose

Fetch Execute Cycle
